# Introduction

Hello budgeters!

I hope you all enjoyed the last blog post focused on how to use goal templates.  If you haven't read it yet, you might want to start [here](/blog/2023-12-15-automate.md).  While we always recommend embracing the envelope system and [getting a month ahead](/blog/2023-12-15-automate.md#month-ahead) on your budget, there are some situations where that just isn't possible right away.  I'm going to introduce a method here that uses the goal template system that uses your income as you receive it throughout the month using priorities.

# The Scenario

In this scenario, my income will be 500 per week, starting on the first of the month.  I have certain priorities that need to be met. For example, I like to eat so I'm going to prioritize food for the first pay period.  I'm going to set up my mortgage to be paid at the end of the month.  I'm also going to use a very basic template to illustrate this method.  Feel free to use other template types.

|Category|How much I need per week, and when|Template used for the category|
|:---|:---:|:---:|
|**Food**|50 per week, every week|#template-10 50<br/> #template-20 50<br/> #template-30 50<br/> #template-40 50|
|**Restaurants**|25 per week, every week.  Food category is more important.|#template-15 25<br/>#template-25 25<br/>#template-35 25<br/>#template-45 25|
|**Entertainment**|10 per week, every week|#template-13 10<br/>#template-23 10<br/>#template-33 10<br/>#template-43 10|
|**Clothing**|20 per week for first two weeks, then 5 per week|#template-11 20<br/>#template-21 20<br/>#template-31 5<br/>#template-41 5|
|**General**|30 in the first week, but all other first week categories are more important|#template-19 30|
|**Gift**|No gifts this month||
|**Medical**|50 when all other goals are met|#template-50 25|
|**Savings**|All extra money after goals are met|#template remainder|
|**Cell**|40 due in the first week|#template-12 40|
|**Internet**|100 due in the fourth week|#template-40 100|
|**Mortgage**|Save 200 per week so 800 is available in week 4|#template-10 200<br/>#template-20 200<br/>#template-30 200<br/>#template-40 200|
|**Water**|130 due in the third week|#template-30 130|
|**Power**|120 due in the second week|#template-20 150|

You'll notice I used different priorities for different categories.  When the goal templates are applied, the categories will be filled in the following order.  I've bolded the categories that will only be filled for certain periods.

|First week|Second week|Third week|Fourth week|Leftovers|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|1. Food<br/>2. Mortgage<br/>3. Clothing<br/>**4. Cell**<br/>5. Entertainment<br/>6. Restaurants<br/>**7. General**<br/>|1. Food<br/>2. Mortgage<br/>**3. Power**<br/>4. Clothing<br/>5. Entertainment<br/>6. Restaurants<br/>|1. Food<br/>2. Mortgage<br/>**3. Water**<br/>4. Clothing<br/>5. Entertainment<br/>6. Restaurants<br/>|1. Food<br/>2. Mortgage<br/>**3. Internet**<br/>4. Clothing<br/>5. Entertainment<br/>6. Restaurants|**1. Medical**<br/>**2. Savings**|
Here is a quick animation showing the results.  For each week I receive new income, I reapply the templates.  You'll see that each of my categories gets filled a little more each time.  If I have a little extra from one week, it will start filling up the categories for the next weeks goals.  When I receive my final pay in the fourth week, my final two categories receive some funding.

This approach allows you to fill your budget categories as your income arrives by prioritizing your needs and allows you to spend from your categories along the way.  

### Receive first income deposit

### Apply budget templates
Notice that both Food, Power, and Cell categories have received funding this round.  The templates are already funding goals for week 2!

### Receive second week's income and 'Overwrite with budget templates'
Notice that week 3 goals are already being funded.  Most of the categories still show a yellow indicator.  This means that they still need more funding this moth to reach all of your goals.  If they have turned green, like General, Cell, and Power, the target goal has been reached.

### Receive third week's income and 'Overwrite with budget templates'
More green category balances! Keep in mind, you can spend from these categories along the way.  I simply didn't show any spending in these graphics.

### Receive fourth week's income and 'Overwrite with budget templates'
This is the final pay period for the month.  I was successful in reaching all of my target goals.  There was even a little extra for the savings category!  Amazing!

# Conclusion

Thanks for following along.  Although this may be an unconventional way to use priorities, especially for those of you who are a month ahead, this shows the power of priorities in Actual and how they could be used effectively for everyone with different situations.
