We are introducing a new policy for managing experimental features. This is to ensure the codebase does not become cluttered with unfinished features.

The short version is:

- abandoned experimental features will be removed from the codebase
- experimental features cannot be used as a toggle for small visual and/or functional quirks (i.e should category selector show hidden categories or not?)

Read more in the [feature flags](/docs/contributing/project-details/feature-flags) page.
