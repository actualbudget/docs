Our open source community has reached an exciting point: thanks to the incredible generosity of our donors, we now have a steady flow of funds coming in. First of all — thank you.

This support allows us to make the project more sustainable for everyone involved. We want to start by addressing something that is often overlooked in open source: the invisible labour that keeps everything running.

We’re proposing a 3-month trial program to pay our core maintainers for the essential (but often unglamorous) work of:

- Reviewing pull requests
- Triage and categorize GitHub issues
- Preparing releases

We think it’s time we recognized that labor financially — but before we move forward, we want your feedback.

## What We’re Proposing

Starting July 1st, we’d like to set aside $1,000 per month from the project’s funds for a review stipend pool. This pool would be divided between **core maintainers** based on the work they do each month, measured via a transparent points system.

- Points are assigned based on the size of PRs reviewed (using lines of code as a proxy for effort).
- Additional points are awarded for labelling and grooming issues, closing duplicates, and managing releases.
- The system has a cap, and in months with less activity, the payout is reduced to $500.
- Payments are handled via OpenCollective and only available to core maintainers.

This system is designed to be lightweight, fair, and easy to administer — and it keeps our monthly costs well within our donation income.

## Why Start With Admin Work?

Before we think about feature bounties or bug bounties, we need to acknowledge the day-to-day labor that enables any of those contributions to be merged and released. Paying for features while leaving critical admin work unpaid would be unsustainable — and unfair.

This trial is the foundation for broader funding efforts down the line. But it starts with respecting the work already being done.

## What We Need From You

We believe this is the right direction — but we won’t go ahead without the community’s support.

- If you’re for it, against it, or have suggestions — let us know.
- If there’s strong opposition, we won’t implement it.
- If the community supports it, we’ll begin the trial in July.

Join the conversation on Discord or in our GitHub discussions.
We’re listening — and we’ll publish a summary of the feedback before moving forward.

## What’s Next?

- We’ll collect community feedback until late June.
- If there’s consensus, the 3-month trial begins July 1st.
- After the trial, we’ll evaluate how it went and where to go next.
