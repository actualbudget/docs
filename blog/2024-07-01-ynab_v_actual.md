Hello budgeters!

This is the start of the series **Actual Versus**!
Today we will be viewing how Actual Budget stacks up against the long standing YNAB (You Need a Budget).

YNAB is a longstanding heavywight in the envelope budgeting space.  It was one of the originals.
Actual takes a lot of inspiration from the original old YNAB4 and builds upon it.

# Introduction
I will structure this comparison as follows.
First I will go over some of the fundamentals individually, then at the end have a quick comparison of some of the smaller features.
I will go in depth in the basics like how Actual is installed and run, how the budgeting basics compare, and then the other exciting features.

# Using Actual

This may be the place were Actual and YNAB are the most different.
YNAB is a service. This means that the user has minimal control over the application and data.
This also means that YNAB owns your budget data.  They say that they keep it safe, but that could change any time they want to.


# Core Feature Comparison

## Budgeting
The core budgeting style is where Actual and YNAB are the most similar.
Both use envelope style budgeting, sometimes refered to zero-sum budgeting.
This means that all your funds are assigned categories, or jobs in YNAB vernacular.
This is much more expicit of budgeting than the traditional style where you simply track income and expenses in a given time window.
This budgeting is based on the same paradigm of transactions with payees and categories in an account ledger.
