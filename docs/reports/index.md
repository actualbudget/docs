## Net worth

Net worth shows the balance of all accounts over time. Your net worth is all of your cash and assets minus and debts you owe. Net worth shows the balance of all accounts over time, including all of your investments. Your “net worth” is considered to be the amount you’d have if you sold all your assets and paid off as much debt as possible.

## Cash flow

Cash flow shows your spending over time. It only looks at budgeted accounts and shows their balance over time, and includes separate income and expense visualizations. It's a quick way to see how your income and expenses effected your available money over time. Your budgeted accounts are considered to be “cash on hand,” so this gives you a picture of how available money fluctuates.
