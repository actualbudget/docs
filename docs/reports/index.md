## Reports

The reports dashboard gives you a graphical representation of your net worth and cash flow on a monthly, yearly, and daily basis. There is also the option to create your own custom reports using Actual's powerful report engine to view your data in the ways that are most useful to you.

## Filters

Filtering gives you the ability to pull transactions based on a variety of criteria that you set. These can be one-off queries or you can save these filters for future use.  These filters can also be used to fine tune the data used in reports.
