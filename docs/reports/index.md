# Reports

Currently Actual comes with two reports: **net worth** and **cash flow**. These are valuable reports, but in the future many more report types will be available.

There will also be a way to create custom reports. Subscribe to [the feature request for custom reports](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual/issues/730) to receive updates.

## Net worth

Net worth shows the balance of all accounts over time. Your net worth is all of your cash and assets minus and debts you owe.

## Cash flow

Cash flow shows your spending over time. It only looks at budgeted accounts and shows their balance over time, and includes separate income and expense visualizations. It's a quick way to see how your income and expenses effected your available money over time.
