title: Configuring the Server
---

When it starts up, Actual looks for an optional `config.json` file in the same directory as its `package.json`. If present, any keys you define there will override the default values. All values can also be specified as environment variables, which will override the values in the `config.json` file.

## `ACTUAL_CONFIG_PATH`

This is the path to the config file. If not specified, the server will look for a `config.json` file either in the `/data` directory if it is present, or in the same directory as the `package.json` if `/data` is not present.

You can’t specify this option in `config.json` since it needs to be used to find the `config.json` in the first place.

## `https`

If you want to Actual to serve over HTTPS, you can set this key to an object with the following keys:

- `key`: The path to the private key file. (environment variable: `ACTUAL_HTTPS_KEY`)
- `cert`: The path to the certificate file. (environment variable: `ACTUAL_HTTPS_CERT`)
- any other options from Node’s [`tls.createServer()`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v16.x/api/tls.html#tlscreateserveroptions-secureconnectionlistener), [`tls.createSecureContext()`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v16.x/api/tls.html#tlscreatesecurecontextoptions), or [`http.createServer()`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v16.x/api/http.html#httpcreateserveroptions-requestlistener) functions (optional, most people won’t need to set any of these).

See [Activating HTTPS](/Installing/HTTPS/) for more information on how to get HTTPS working.

<!-- ## `mode`

The `mode` key is not currently used by anything, as far as I can tell. It’s exposed on the `/mode` route, but that route does not appear to be called by the frontend. -->

## `port`

The `port` key is used to specify the port that the server should listen on. If not specified, the server will listen on port 5006. (environment variable: `ACTUAL_PORT`)

## `hostname`

The `hostname` key is used to specify the hostname that the server should listen on. If not specified, the server will listen on `::` (which, on most operating systems, will include both IPv4 and IPv6). (environment variable: `ACTUAL_HOSTNAME`)

## `serverFiles`

The server will put an `account.sqlite` file in this directory, which will contain the (hashed) server password, a list of all the budget files the server knows about, and the active session token (along with anything else the server may want to store in the future). If not specified, the server will use either `/data/server-files` (if `/data` exists) or the `server-files` directory in the same directory as the `package.json`. (environment variable: `ACTUAL_SERVER_FILES`)

## `userFiles`

The server will put all the budget files in this directory as binary blobs. If not specified, the server will use either `/data/user-files` (if `/data` exists) or the `user-files` directory in the same directory as the `package.json`. (environment variable: `ACTUAL_USER_FILES`)

## `webRoot`

(Advanced, most people will not need to configure this.) The server will serve the frontend from this directory. If not specified, the server will use the files in the `@actual-app/web` package that it has installed. (environment variable: `ACTUAL_WEB_ROOT`)

If you’re providing a custom frontend, make sure you provide an `index.html` in the top level of the `webRoot` directory, which will be served from the `/` route.

## `bank-sync`
*config.js or env variables depending on how you are running Actual*

**Nordigen**
- After you have updated your fly.io version or deployed a new version, you will need to add your Nordigen SECRET ID and KEY by running a flyctl command.  
*Run the following command in your terminal application, making sure to replace xxxxx with your SECRET ID and KEY from what you generated in Nordigen.*  
    `flyctl secrets set ACTUAL_NORDIGEN_SECRET_ID=xxxxx ACTUAL_NORDIGEN_SECRET_KEY=xxxxx`
    
- For all other installs you need to add your Nordigen SECRET KEY and ID to a config.json file in actual-server.
*If you don't already have this file, you will need to create it and add the following lines replacing xxxxx with your SECRET ID and KEY.*
     
    {
        "nordigen": {
            "secretId": "xxxx",
            "secretKey": "xxxxx"
        }
    }
