## Deploying Actual on PikaPods

[PikaPods](https://www.pikapods.com/) offers one click "instant open source app hosting", allowing
you to run Actual for a little more than $1 per month (price may have changed since this document was updated).

## Deploying

[Click here to create an account and run Actual on PikaPods](https://www.pikapods.com/pods?run=actual). You can leave the resources at their lowest setting (although you will need a non-zero amount of storage for your budget files).

_Actual does almost all of its computation in your browser, so purchasing more resources for the server wonâ€™t necessarily result in a better experience_
