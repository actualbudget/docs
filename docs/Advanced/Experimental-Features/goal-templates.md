title: 'Budget Goal Templates'

:::warning
This is an **experimental feature**. That means weâ€™re still working on finishing it. There may be bugs, missing functionality or incomplete documentation, and we may decide to remove the feature in a future release. If you have any feedback, please [open an issue](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual/issues) or post a message in the Discord.

Create a template by adding a note to a category and adding a line that begins with `#template`.

You are welcome to have other lines in your note, but the #template line must match the syntax.

### Notes
* $ sign is optional, `#template $50` and `#template 50` are the same.
* Other currency symbols are not supported.
* Number formats that use comma for the decimal seperator are not supported (eg, 123,45). You must use 123.45.
* Thousands separators are not supported (eg, 1,234). You must use 1234.

### Multiple Template Lines
You can add multiple `#template` lines for a single category note. Lines that don't have a 'by' keyword in them add together, where as lines that do have the 'by' keyword are run sequentially - only the next next due template line is applied.

For examples:

**Budget $200/month for 3 months, then $400/month for the next 3 months**

    #template $600 by 2021-03 repeat every 6 months

    #template $1200 by 2021-06 repeat every 6 months


**Streaming Services: $42.97**

    Netflix
    #template $24.99
    Disney Plus
    #template $9.99
    Amazon Prime
    #template $7.99

**$120 in February 2022, $130 in March 2022**

    #template $10 repeat every 2 weeks starting 2022-01-04
    #template $100

## Apply the templates

To apply the goal templates you create, enable the feature in the Settings experimental section.  When the feature is on, two new options will appear in the monthly budget actions list.

**Apply budget template** will only fill empty cells using the templates.

**Overwrite with budget template** will fill in all budget cells using the templates.
