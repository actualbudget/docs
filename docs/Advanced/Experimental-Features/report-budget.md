title: 'Report Budget'

The **Report Budget** feature can be switched on from the Experimental features section within the Settings page.

There are several important differences between the **Report Budget** and the default **Rollover Budget** type.

* Category balances do not rollover from month to month
* "To Be Budgeted" has been replaced with a "Saved" metric
* Income is forecasted rather than using what is available

## Creating a budget

If you are creating a budget for the first time, here's how it works:

1. Assign the amount of income you expect to receive in the current month.
2. Assign the amount of money you need for each of your categories.  Starting from the second month of use, you can choose the **Copy last month's budget** item from the menu next to the Month to quickly fill these cells if you have recurring budget amounts for categories and manually edit the categories that need adjusting.

Once completing these two tasks for the month, you will see the budgeted totals in the monthly header in gray.  The expected savings you will incur for the month will show up in the **Saved** field.  When you receive new income or spend from your categories, enter those transactions in the account registers. Your budget is not static, so there will be times when you do not have enough budgeted for your spending.  When one of your categories is overdrawn, increase the budgeted amount for that category so it is 0 or greater.  The **Savings** field is calculated from your actual income minus actual expenses, so expect the **Savings** to decrease when covering overspending.

There are useful pie charts next to **Income** and **Expenses** to track your progress visually.

1. An incomplete green pie means your total expenses or income are less than your total amount budgeted for expenses or income, respectively.

2. A complete green pie chart means your spending and budget are exactly the same.

3. A pie chart that has turned red means you have overspent your total budget.

## How money rolls over

If you have overspending in any category, you may wish to carry this balance forward into the next month.  This can be done by clicking on the **Balance** of the category and select **Rollover Overspending**.  

:::note
If you utilize the **Rollover Overspending** feature on a category that is not over spent, the entire spent amount will be forwarded to the next month and the **Saved** amount will increase for the current month.
