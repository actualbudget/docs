# Actual Server repository move

In February 2025 the actual-server repository will be merged into the Actual repository.

The reasons for this change are as follows:

- Streamlines Development: Developers will only need to clone/sync one repo instead of two.
- Improves Debugging: It makes end-to-end debugging for server/client easier as they will be in the same workspace.
- Simplifies Desktop App Packaging: Enables the desktop app to embed the sync server.
- Ensures code consistency and reduces the maintenance burden.
- Simplifies the release process

### Questions:

- **Q.** _I use Docker Hub/Github's container registry, how do I stay up to date?_

  **A.** We will continue to push images to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/actualbudget/actual-server) and [Github's container registry](https://ghcr.io/actualbudget/actual) as usual.


- **Q.** _I build the docker image locally, can I still do that?_

  **A.** All of the docker files are still available. To build the sync server locally you can use the ``` sync-server.Dockerfile``` located in the root of the repository.  The ``` docker-compose.yml ``` is located in the ```/packages/sync-server``` directory.


- **Q.** _I [Build from source](https://actualbudget.org/docs/install/build-from-source). How do I keep up to date?_

  **A.** Below are steps to clone the updated setup and then migrate your existing data:
  
  (If you are on Windows, you'll need to install [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/download).)

  1. Open Bash, then Clone the [Actual repository](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual). You can use the following command:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/actualbudget/actual.git
  ```
  2. Navigate to the Actual project root directory:
  ```
  cd actual
  ```
  3. Install the required dependencies for the server:
  ```
  yarn install
  ```
  4. Build the server:
  ```
  yarn build:server
  ```
  5. If you have a [config.json](https://actualbudget.com/docs/config/) file you will need to copy it into the following directory:
  ```
  packages/sync-server
  ```
  6. Copy over the data from your `actual-server` directory (`user-files`, `server-files`, and `.migrate`) into the `packages/sync-server` directory.
  7. Run the server with:
  ```
  yarn start:server
  ```
