# Carrying Debt
## next level
### nest level

When you have an outstanding negative balance that you are unable to pay in full you are carrying debt. We highly recommend that you do _not_ do this for any new spending as it becomes super easy to accidentally fall into deeper debt. Instead, we recommend that you follow the [Within the Budget](./index.md) strategy for any new credit card purchases. In case you're already carrying a negative balance on a credit card, this page will outline how to safely manage the debt without having to worry about going into more debt.

If you have an existing credit card debt that you need to track and gradually pay off then it's very important that any new purchases you make with the credit card are pre-funded following the [Within the Budget](./index.md) strategy as there is no point in paying off 100 extra on the credit card if you will then have to put another -100 on the card to pay for groceries the next week. First, you should prioritize making sure that your actual expense categories are funded before allocating money to paying down the debt. This will allow you to ensure that you're paying it off in a sustainable manner without accidentally incurring more of it over time.

:::note
To make it easier to follow along, the example screenshots and documents are at the end.

This guide is based on entering transactions manually and clearing and reconciling accounts from a monthly statement. It's a little too easy to spend when you sync all your purchases. Manual entry and reconciliation keeps you in touch with your accounts. When you have paid off your debt, you can link up your card(s) and reconcile from a bank sync.

## Let's Pay Off that Debt!

Before we get started, check the settings for your Credit Card accounts to make it easy to see everything that's going on and we are on the same page:
- Using the 3-dot menu on the right of the account page:
  - Show running balance
  - Show "cleared" checkboxes
  - Show reconciled transactions
- Check that the _pills_ showing "Cleared total" and "Uncleared total" are showing under the account name.
  - To show the pills, hover over the account balance under the account name and press the expand >> arrows.
    <img width="50%" height="50%" alt="Account Page Balance Expand Arrows" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e89b532a-4ee9-4bea-aef9-f5e10c68ce43" />

- When we use either the "Cleared total" or "Uncleared total" we will use the absolute value, the positive value without the (-) sign. So, if Actual shows "Cleared total: -2553.86", then we will use 2553.86.
- While you are paying off your credit card(s), it is best to use a debit card or cash. If that is not possible, and you have a card with no debt, use that one to make new purchases so you can pay it in full every month using [Within the Budget](./index.md) and work to pay off another. In any case, use _**only one credit card**_ for new purchases and pay off the one with the highest interest first.
- We recommend doing this On Budget. If you will not use the card again after it's completely paid off and you have received a statement with a $0 balance, you can [close](LINK HERE) the account.
 
### Setting Up Actual Budget for Credit Card Debt

- Create a **Credit Card Debt** Group 
- Create a **Bank Name Credit Card** category in the group for each card carrying debt. Set them all to _Rollover Overspending_.
  - To set _Rollover Overspending_, right click on the category's Balance and choose it. A little arrow will now show next to the Balance.
- For each credit card account, input a starting balance equal to the **total** amount owed. Include all transactions to date, as if you wanted to close the account. This starting balance goes in the "Payment" column. Change the category on this starting balance to **Bank Name Credit Card**.
- Remember, _any_ purchase that will not be paid for at the next statement is categorized as **Bank Name Credit Card**. 

:::note
If you have been paying the statement balance in full every month, but need to incur debt for an emergency purchase enter the transaction normally, but categorize it as **Bank Name Credit Card**. Use the note field for a note or tag as to why. You can even use a split transaction if you only need to incur debt on part of the purchase!
:::

### Monthly Workflow

#### All Cards with Debt
- You must make Minimum Payments.  
- At the beginning of the month, assign the expected Minimum Payment amount to the **Budgeted** column for each **Bank Name Credit Card** category. These payments are part of your necessary expenses each month. An easy way to calculate the Minimum Payment is to use the one from the last statement.
- Each month when you do your budgeting, _after_ you've accounted for all necessary expense categories, including the minimum payments on each credit card in the **Credit Card Debt** Group, you can add extra to the credit card you want to pay off. Choose to pay off the card with the highest interest rate first. In the **Budgeted** column, **Add** the extra amount to the Minimum Payment you assigned earlier. For example, if your expected Minimum Payment is $113.23 and you want to pay an extra $100, change your **Budgeted** column to 213.23
  
#### Cards with Debt and No New Purchases {#debt-no-new}
- If you are not paying off the debt on this card:
  - When your statement arrives, create the Interest & Fees transaction and categorize it to **Bank Name Credit Card**.
  - Reconcile your account.
  - Make sure the amount in the **Budgeted** column is at least the statement Minimum Balance. If you need to add to it, _Cover_ any overspending by transferring from another category with a positive balance.
  - Transfer the amount in the **Budgeted** column from your deposit account and pay your bill.
- If you are paying off the debt:
  - When your statement arrives, create the Interest & Fees transaction and categorize it to **Bank Name Credit Card**.
  - Reconcile your account.
  - Make sure the amount in the **Budgeted** category is higher than the statement Minimum Payment. One day your Minimum Payment will pay off the card completely! Happy Day!
  - Transfer the amount in the **Budgeted** column from your deposit account and pay your bill.

#### Cards with New Purchases and Original Debt - Following the [Within the Budget](./index.md) Strategy {#debt-with-new}
- During the month, enter your New Purchases and Return Credits as they occur. Categorize them to a Budget category that has a positive Balance, "Groceries", "Clothes", "Transit", etc.
- When your statement arrives, find the following information:
  - New Balance, Minimum Payment, Interest & Fees, Returns/Credits and New Purchases. We will use this information to calculate your payment.
  - Create a transaction for Interest & Fees and categorize it to **Bank Name Credit Card**.
  - [Reconcile](LINK) the account. Clear each and every transaction with your statement, including the Interest & Fees and Return Credits. Fix any problems before you move on. We do not advocate using a Reconciliation Transaction to fix any problems, especially when you are carrying debt. The first month will be the most difficult, but the running balance will help. Make sure that your cleared purchases add up to the New Purchases from your statement.  
- Looking at your statement, your Payment will be at least the sum of the Interest & Fees plus the New Purchases (minus any return credits). Remember, you accounted for and funded the interest at the beginning of the month when you budgeted for the expected Minimum Payment and you were setting aside funds to pay for New Purchases each time you categorized them! You can pay for them all without worry.
  - If you are _not_ paying off any original debt on this card, change the **Budgeted** column to equal the Interest & Fees transaction. 
  - If you _are_ paying off the debt on this card, make sure the current **Budgeted** column is more than the Interest & Fees transaction. It should be at least the sum of the Interest & Fees plus the extra amount you want to pay off, but it might be more and that's OK!
- Now let's calculate your payment. Your payment is the sum of the New Purchases from your statement (minus any return credits) plus the "Uncleared total" from Actual plus the amount in the **Budgeted** column.

:::warning
If the calculated payment is less than the statement Minimum Payment, you _**must**_ make the statement Minimum Payment! In this rare case, add an amount to the **Budgeted** column so your resulting payment adds up to at least the statement Minimum Payment.
:::

- Transfer the calculated amount from your deposit account and pay your bill.
- One day you won't need to add any extra to pay the credit card bill in full! Happy Day! Keep on paying at least your statement balance every month and soon you will gain back your Grace Period and you will stop accruing interest on new purchases! Woot! Follow the [Within the Budget](./index.md) strategy and you will never carry debt or pay credit card interest again.

Examples:

At he beginning of the month we budget for the expected Minimum Payment as part of our necessary expenses.



After all of our expenses are accounted for, we have $202.29 leftover and we decide to add $200 extra to our Citibank Credit Card. We add $200 to our expected Minimum Payment. The $2.29 we will Hold for next Month.



During the month, we spend using our Budget as a guide. We use the DEMO Credit Card for some of our purchases. We do not use the Citibank Card.

The Citibank Statement arrives and the account summary looks something like this:

**Account Summary**
- Statement Period: June 9, 2025 – July 8, 2025
- Account Number: 1234 5678 9012 3456
- Credit Limit: $5,000.00
- Available Credit: $2,436.00
- Previous Balance: $2,590.00
- Payments Received: $90.00
- New Purchases: $0.00
- Cash Advances: $0.00
- Fees Charged: $0.00
- Interest Charged: $64.00
- New Balance: $2564.00
- Payment Due Date: July 16, 2025
- Minimum Payment Due: $90.00

Following [Cards with Debt and No New Purchases](#debt-no-new) we enter a transaction into the Citibank account for the Interest & Fees and categorize it to **Citi Card Debt**. We reconcile the account, agreeing with Citibank that our New Balance is $2564.00.

Our **Budgeted** amount of 290.00 is larger than the Minimum Payment of $90.00, so we send Citibank $290.00 and transfer that amount from the deposit account we used to pay the bill.

You will notice that the Citibank Balance matches the **Citi Card Debt** Balance. The Interest & Fees we added to the debt were canceled by our **Budgeted** amount that included them.

We budgeted for August and started with our Minimum Payments of $90 for the Citibank card and $50 for the DEMO card, then added an extra $100 payment for the DEMO card this month.

In August we receive our DEMO Card statement and the account summary looks like this:

 Account Summary
- Statement Period: July 1, 2025 – July 31, 2025
- Account Number: 5333 1234 5678 1116
- Credit Limit: $5,000.00
- Available Credit: $2,946.70
- Previous Balance: $1,235.50
- Payments Received: $50.00
- New Purchases: $835.55
- Cash Advances: $0.00
- Fees Charged: $0.00
- Interest Charged: $32.75
- New Balance: $2,053.30
- Payment Due Date: August 20, 2025
- Minimum Payment Due: $50.00

We'll follow [Cards with New Purchases and Original Debt](#debt-with-new} above to calculate our payment.

First, we'll enter the Interest & Fees transaction
