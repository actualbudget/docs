Categories are organized into groups and same actions can be performed on groups.

## Merging categories

Let's say you have two categories that are the same but you want to delete one.

Hover over the category and select the drop down that appears and select `Delete`

If the category you're deleting has a positive balance **OR** has been used for existing transactions you will be presented with a box to select which category the balance and/or transactions should be moved to.

In our example, we want to use `Food` which will take over from `Foods` once you are happy, click `Delete`

You can see in the budget that our categories have now been successfully merged and the positive balance moved to the new category.

## Expanding, Collapsing or Hiding Categories
Updates, in June and July 2023, added the ability to (a) *expand or collapse category groups* by clicking on the three dots at the top of the Category list and (b) *hide categories* that are no longer needed (using the down arrow by each category name). Hidden categories can be viewed, when needed, by clicking on the three dots at the top of the category list. The screenshots above do not currently reflect these enhancements.

## Category Notes

It is possible to add notes to Categories. To do this, hover over the category that you would like to add a note to. A paper icon will appear.

## Viewing Category Notes

Once a Category has been given a note it is possible to view it in one of two ways.

1. Hover over the paper icon on the category and the note contents will appear for you to view.
