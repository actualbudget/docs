# Restart your Budget (without removing transactions)

If you've fallen behind on your budgeting and want to start fresh without starting from scratch, follow these steps to reset your budget:

## Step 1: Address Uncategorized Transactions

- Go through any transactions that haven't been categorized.
- If you're unsure where to assign certain transactions, create a temporary category named **"Budget Reset"**.
- Once you've categorized all transactions, you can hide this temporary category.

## Step 2: Reconcile Your Accounts

Using the **Reconcile** feature, bring your accounts up to date with a current balance. This ensures that your accounts reflect the actual available funds.

## Step 3: Adjust Previous Months' Budgets

- Navigate to the month prior to your new start (e.g., the end of May, if the month you're restarting from is June).
- Review each budget category:
  - If a category has a **negative balance**, allocate additional funds to bring the balance to zero.
  - If a category has a **positive balance**, click on the category and transfer the balance amount back to the **"To Budget"** area.
