### Frequently Asked Questions

**Does Actual sync automatically with your Bank?**

At this moment, it is not yet possible for Actual to automatically sync with your bank. You need to do this manually by going to "All Accounts" and pressing "Sync".

**The best way to start from scratch in Actual with GoCardless?**

If you are setting up Actual for the first time, it is much easier not to try to pull in historic data. This has caused some users a lot of headaches with subsequent reconciliation. The following process may be more helpful:
1. Set up your account in Actual specifying a correct opening account balance at a recent date.
2. Link the account to GoCardless as above
3. Sync the account with GoCardless. You should find that only transactions subsequent to the opening account balance entry are imported, making reconciliation easy.


**How many times can I sync with  GoCardless?**

In the free tier, you can connect up to 50 banks per month. If one of your banks include more than one account inside (like credit and debit cards), it will still be counted as one connection.
Every day you can sync each bank up to 4 times and there is no monthly limit though, just the daily one.
For more information, see the [Bank Account Data API Usage](https://bankaccountdata.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/11528933493916-Bank-Account-Data-API-Usage-how-is-your-usage-number-calculated)
topic in the GoCardless FAQ.

**What if my bank only supports 90 days of historical data?**

If your bank limits the amount of historical data you can fetch, you need to add your bank to the list of such banks in the Actual server code.

To achieve this:

1. Read the instructions about integrating with GoCardless: https://github.com/actualbudget/actual/blob/master/packages/sync-server/src/app-gocardless/README.md
2. Toward the top is a link to the Google Docs containing data points for the GoCardless integration. Locate your bank's ID in the document.
3. Fork the Actual repository: https://github.com/actualbudget/actual/fork
4. Edit the file `packages/sync-server/src/app-gocardless/bank-factory.js`.
5. Add your bank's ID (from the Google Docs) to the `BANKS_WITH_LIMITED_HISTORY` list.
6. Commit your changes and push to your fork.
7. Create a pull request to the main Actual repository.
8. Add a release note in `upcoming-release-notes/` describing your change (see [writing good release notes](/docs/contributing/#writing-good-release-notes)).
9. Commit your changes and push to your fork.

Once reviewed, the maintainers will comment on the pull request and merge it if acceptable. The change would then be available in the next release of the software.
