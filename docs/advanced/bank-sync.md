# Connecting Your Bank

:::note
Client Version 23.7.0 and
Server Version 23.7.0 or higher are required for this feature.

We are excited to offer this optional bank integration in Actual. Here are a couple of considerations to know about before making the decision to use bank sync in your installation of Actual Budget.

- This integration relies on you providing your own API credentials that you will need to get by signing up with the service provider and Generate Keys and Secrets that will be used in Actual.

- The integration only works if you are using actual-server

- The Secrets and Keys are stored in your Actual installed version so it is highly recommended to turn on End to End encryption and create a strong passphrase to encrypt your files.

- You will need to add a config file to your installation

### Supported Providers

GoCardless

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Does Actual sync automatically with your Bank?**

At this moment, it is not yet possible for Actual to automatically sync with your bank. You need to do this manually by going to "All Accounts" and pressing "Sync".

**The best way to start from scratch in Actual with Go Cardless?**

If you are setting up Actual for the first time, it is much easier not to try to pull in historic data. This has caused some users a lot of headaches with subsequent reconciliation. The following process may be more helpful:
1. Set up your account in Actual specifying a correct opening account balance at a recent date.
2. Link the account to Go Cardless as above
3. Sync the account with Go Cardless. You should find that only transactions subsequent to the opening account balance entry are imported, making reconciliation easy.
