[Click here](simple-sync) if you are looking for the steps to migrate from "full sync" to (the more reliable) "simple sync" method.

Keeping your existing transaction history is important. If you already use a different app, you probably want to migrate it over into Actual.

Right now, only YNAB4 is officially supported. However, the [API](/developers/API/) allows anyone to write a custom importer. We will work with the community to help write other importers soon.

[YNAB4](ynab4) is the only built-in importer right now. We're hoping the community can help build other importers on top of the [API](/developers/API/).

:::note
There are guides [here](../../Advanced/advanced-intro) for some advanced migration tasks.
