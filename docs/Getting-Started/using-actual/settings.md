### Encryption

End to End Encryption is not actually available in Actual version 20.10.25, this is due to the way the Sync system was working, we are working on re-enabling this feature and will update this documentation once that is available.

### Export

Actual is local first, with this, it is possible to export your data from Actual, when you do this you will be given a zip file to download which will contain the SQLLite database along with your budget.
