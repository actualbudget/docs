Create a template by adding a note to a category and adding a line that begins with `#template`.

You are welcome to have other lines in your note, but the #template line must match the syntax.

### Notes

- Currency symbol is optional, `#template $50` and `#template 50` are the same.
- Number formats that use comma for the decimal separator are not supported (eg, 123,45). You must use 123.45.
- Thousands separators are not supported (eg, 1,234). You must use 1234.
- {SCHEDULE NAME} is defined in the **Schedules** editor. **Take great care to copy across these schedule names EXACTLY**, without braces.
- By default templates do not consider available funds when being applied. Use template priorities to not budget more than is available.
- The `hold` flag can be added to any goal that uses the `up to` key word.
- A single category with two templates that use `up to` is not supported.
- If in a category there are multiple templates within the same priority level and one template uses the `up to` key word, all templates in that priority level will be limited to the maximum amount specified by `up to`.

### Multiple Template Lines

You can add multiple `#template` lines for a single category note. Each line will be added together.

For examples:

**Budget $200/month for 3 months and $400/month for the next 3 months**

    #template $600 by 2024-06 repeat every 6 months

    #template $1200 by 2024-09 repeat every 6 months

**Streaming Services: $42.97**

    Netflix
    #template $24.99
    Disney Plus
    #template $9.99
    Amazon Prime
    #template $7.99

**$120 in February 2022, $130 in March 2025**

    #template $10 repeat every 2 weeks starting 2025-01-04
    #template $100

## Template Priorities

Templates can be given a priority flag to change the order that the templates get applied to your budget. Set a priority by adding `-X` to the `#template` flag. EX `#template-4` will be priority level 4. Any template with a priority other than 0 will not apply more funds then are available.

### Notes

- Lower priority values get run first. EX 0 is run first, then 1, then 2, etc.
- No priority flag defaults to priority 0 and is the same as a standard template.
- Negative priorities are not allowed and will result in the template being skipped.
- Template application order is based on the database order, not the view order.  To guarantee a specific fill order use separate priorities for each category.
- If you have multiple `schedule` or `by` template lines in a single category, they will be forced to match the same priority level as the line run first.
- If the `up to` key words are used with a category that has multiple templates with different priorities, the lowest priority will take precedence because it is evaluated last as shown in the following examples.
- It is recommended to use the "overwrite with budget template" option when applying templates if you use priorities.

    - **Expected budgeted amount is 200**  
    **Expected maximum category balance is 200**

        #template 300
        #template-1 150 up to 200
        
    - **Expected budgeted amount is 450**  
    **No maximum category balance exists**

        #template 150 up to 500
        #template-1 300

## Remainder Template

The remainder template is run differently to the other templates. Any remainder templates will be forced to run last in their own pass. This way the remaining budget is after all other templates have had a chance to run. Below are a few considerations when using the remainder template

- You can use as many remainder templates as you want
- Remainder templates don't have a priority as they are always run last
- The remainder template supports weights to control the distribution of funds across multiple categories. See the examples on how this is done.
- If no weight is provided, the weight will be defaulted to 1
- The budgeted amount is calculated as `budgeted_amount=available_funds/sum_of_weights*category_weight`

### Examples

All the examples below use the case of $100 leftover when the remainder pass is run.

1. Add all remaining funds to a single category

| Category | Template line       | Amount applied |
| -------- | ------------------- | -------------- |
| Savings  | #template remainder | $100           |

2. Split funds evenly between two categories

| Category      | Template line       | Amount applied |
| ------------- | ------------------- | -------------- |
| Savings       | #template remainder | $50            |
| Vacation Fund | #template remainder | $50            |

3. Split funds with one category receiving extra

| Category      | Template line         | Amount applied |
| ------------- | --------------------- | -------------- |
| Savings       | #template remainder 2 | $66.66         |
| Vacation Fund | #template remainder   | $33.34         |

4. Spread funds over many categories

| Category        | Template line         | Amount applied |
| --------------- | --------------------- | -------------- |
| Savings         | #template remainder 3 | $50            |
| Vacation Fund   | #template remainder   | $16.66         |
| Investment Fund | #template remainder 2 | $33.34         |

## Goal Directive

This option is unique enough to warrant its own directive `goal` instead of the standard `template` option.
The `goal` option overrides how the goal indicator typically functions.  
In the standard templates, the goal indication colors are based on the current month's budgeted value.
When using the `goal` option, the indication is based on the total balance.  
This shifts the indication to a long-term goal you are saving up to instead of just the current monthly portion.  
A few examples have been given to illustrate this difference.

### Notes 
* The `goal` templates are run the same way as the other templates but using the month options or the category budget options.
* If there is a `goal` directive in a category, the indicator for that category will be based on the total balance compared to the amount set in the template line.
* The `goal` directive will not budget any funds, and funds budgeted by hand will not get reset by running templates.
* A `goal` line can be stacked with templates to automatically budget the category(via the templates) but override how the category goal is indicated(the goal line).
* If templates are included with a `goal`, the budgeted amount will get overwritten when using the "overwrite with budget template" button.
* There is no priority on a `goal` line.

### Examples
All examples assume that $400 was carried over from the previous month

####  1. I'm saving for a large purchase, but I'm still determining how much I can allocate each month.
In this case, a balance greater than or equal to 500 will set the balance green, marking a met goal.
If you run the template, you get the following:

| Template Line(s) | Amount budgeted | Balance(color) |
|:---|:--:|---:|
| `#goal 500` | 0 | 400(yellow) |

If you were able to budget 100 this month, you would then hit your goal and get a green indication.

| Template Line(s) | Amount budgeted | Balance(color) |
|:---|:--:|---:|
| `#goal 500` | 100 | 500(green) |

#### 2. I'm saving for a purchase, but I will budget 50 a month until I reach my goal.
In this example, a template is used to automatically budget 50 into the category when templates are run.
The goal line will override the goal indication from the `template` line, and only go green when a balance of 500 is reached.
If you run templates, you get the following:

| Template Line(s) | Amount budgeted | Balance(indication color) |
|:---|:---:|---:|
| `#template 50` `#goal 500` | 50 | 450(yellow) |

If you have some extra funds after templates are run and can budget that last 50, you get the following:

| Template Line(s) | Amount budgeted | Balance(indication color) |
|:---|:---:|---:|
| `#template 50` `#goal 500` | 100 | 500(green) |


## Apply the templates

To apply the goal templates you create, enable the feature in the Settings experimental section. When the feature is on, three new options will appear in the monthly budget actions list.

![](/img/goal-template/goal-template-2.png)

**Check templates** will test all template lines for proper syntax.

**Apply budget template** will only fill empty cells using the templates.

**Overwrite with budget template** will fill in all budget cells using the templates.

### Goal Indicators
After having run the templates in a given month the status of a respective category goal will be indicated as a text color of the category balance.  The image below shows an example of categories in the following states: normal (no goal set), zero (no goal set), goal met, goal not met, and a negative balance.
