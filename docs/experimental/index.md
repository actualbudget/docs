# Experimental features

Experimental features are features that you can try out before they're ready.
There may be bugs, missing functionality or incomplete documentation. We may remove
missing features at any point in a future release.

Experimental features are **disabled by default**. You must enable them manually in the
['Experimental features' section in Advanced settings](tour/settings.md#experimental-features).

:::danger
Before enabling any experimental feature, **always [back up your budget](backup-restore/backup.md) first**.
Experimental features may corrupt it or cause irrecoverable errors. Back up your budget so you can recover it if this happens.

## Enabling experimental features

To enable any experimental feature:

1. Open your budget's [settings](tour/settings.md).
