# Experimental Features

It can take a long time to fully develop and test new features.
In order to make development easier, and to allow users to give feedback, Actual has a system of `experimental features`.
These experimental features are generally opt-in.
If the user doesn't opt-in to enabling the feature there will be no change in user experience.

These features are still in active development and therefore it is highly recommended to have a regular backup if you enable any of these features.
