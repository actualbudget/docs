### Setup Meu Pluggy

*Meu Pluggy* is a free integration provided by Pluggy.ai for developers. You need to sync your bank using this tool to access it for free.

2. Follow the instructions provided on the official [github repository](https://github.com/pluggyai/meu-pluggy).

### Pluggy Notes & Limitations

1. Item IDs are associated with user-authorized connections and will expire if access is revoked or the token expires.
2. Use the sandbox environment for testing — test credentials are available in the [Pluggy Docs](https://docs.pluggy.ai/docs/quick-pluggy-introduction#sandbox-environment).
3. Data refresh frequency may vary by financial institution.

### Resetting Pluggy Credentials

To reset your Pluggy connection:

1. In Actual, click **Add Account**.
2. Next to “Set-up Pluggy for bank-sync”, open the three-dot menu.
3. Click **Reset Pluggy credentials**.

You'll then need to generate a new API key and obtain a new Item ID to reconnect.
