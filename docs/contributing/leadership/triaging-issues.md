# Triaging Issues

Triaging issues is essential for keeping the project organized and making it easier for contributors to find tasks. Here's how to approach the process:

## Identifying Issues That Need Triage

Start by looking for issues labeled with `needs triage`. These are the ones that require your attention. Every issue should be reviewed to ensure it is clear, actionable, and properly labeled.

## Labeling Issues

Each issue should have two types of labels:

- **Contextual labels** describe the area or feature the issue relates to, such as `responsive (mobile)`, `reports`, `accounts`, or `transactions`. Choose the label that best matches the context of the issue.
- **Call to action labels** indicate what kind of help or action is needed, like `help wanted`, `good first issue`, or `tech debt`. Select the most appropriate one for the issue.

If an issue is missing information or is unclear, add the `needs info` label. When this label is present, the issue will automatically close in 7 days if the original poster does not reply with the requested information. Regularly review issues with `needs info` to see if they have been updated.

Once you have added the appropriate labels, remove the `needs triage` label. Make sure the issue is clear and actionable before doing so. If it is not, request more information and use the `needs info` label.

## Tech Support and Directing Users to Discord

Don't hesitate to close issues that are tech support requests or not actionable for the development team. GitHub issues are not used for tech support. Instead, direct users to the wider community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/8JfAXSgfRf). This is especially important for reports about bank-sync issues, which are most often caused by misconfigured servers or bugs with the bank-sync provider, not the core project. When closing such issues, kindly explain that tech support is handled by the community and provide the Discord link.
