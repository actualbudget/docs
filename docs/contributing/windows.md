# Building on Windows

Many of the build scripts are bash scripts and not natively invokable in Windows. To solve this, you can build the project using Git Bash.

1. Install [Git & Git Bash for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Ensure you have activated [Developer Mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development)
3. Install Node v16.x (latest version 17.x does not work due to issue with crypto package)
4. Clone this repo
5. Using Git Bash (run as administrator), change to the root of this repo
6. From inside the bash shell, run `yarn install`
7. From still inside the shell, run `yarn start:browser`
8. Open your browser to [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

## How to build the Electron app on Windows

1. Follow steps 1 - 6 above.
2. Run `yarn start`. If you get an error about bundle.desktop.js, just <Key mod="ctrl" k="c" /> and rerun `yarn start`.
3. If you get an error from electron, run `yarn rebuild-electron` and rerun `yarn start`;

# Errors

## `rsync: command not found`

If you run into this error, you will need to install the rsync binary to Git Bash. Follow the [directions here](https://prasaz.medium.com/add-rsync-to-windows-git-bash-f42736bae1b3).

## `ln: failed to create symbolic link '../../desktop-client/public/kcab': Operation not permitted`

Bash needs to be run as administrator.
