# Architecture Notes

If you wish to contribute to actual, these details are not essential but can be useful for navigating the structure of the code. 

When actual runs, it runs the front-end react based web app, as well as a local in-browser database server. You may see these informally referred to as 'frontend' and 'backend' - not to be confused with the sync-server or some other type of remote 'backend' (which doesn't exist). 

In the web app, this background server runs in a [web worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers), and in the electron app it spins up a [background process](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v16.x/docs/api/child_process.html#child_processforkmodulepath-args-options) which communicates over [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API).

The code which is used by this background server, as well as code which is shared across the web app and desktop versions of actual typically lives inside the `loot-core` package.

### Electron Notes

* Generally speaking, it is unlikely that features/fixes you contribute to actual will require electron-specific changes. If you think that is likely feel free to discuss on github or in the actual discord.

* Details of the motivation behind the usage of WebSockets in the electron app can be found in the [Pull Request](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual/pull/1003) where the changes were made.
