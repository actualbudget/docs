# Reports & Filters

Actual Budget gives you powerful tools to see not only your current financial assets, but also how they have changed over time.

## Reports

The reports dashboard gives you a graphical representation of your net worth and cash flow on a monthly, yearly, and daily basis. We plan to add more features to the reports page as time goes on, so be sure to check in with each update to see what is new.

## Filters

Filtering gives you the ability to pull transactions based on a variety of criteria that you set. These can be one-off queries or you can save these filters for future use. You are also able to download the transactions as a CSV file to import into other analysis software.
