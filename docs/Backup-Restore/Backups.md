   ![](/img/actual-config-4.png)

2. Select Settings

   ![](/img/actual-config-5.png)

3. Scroll down to the Export section and click Export Data

## Manually creating a backup from the desktop app

This will force a backup to be created right now. Do this if you are going to do something that you might want to revert later (and don't want to use [undo](/Getting-Started/tipstricks/#undoredo)).

- Select the **File > Load Backupâ€¦** menu item
- Click **Backup Now**
