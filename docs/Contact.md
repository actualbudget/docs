# Contacting Us

:::note

Actual is an open source app, which means that nobody is being paid to work on it, and everything is happening in our free time. Please keep that in mind when asking us for help :)

We are happy to help out with any issues you encounter with getting Actual running or using it. There are a few ways to get help:
