# User Interface Overview

The user interface is divided into three parts:

Standard on most screens:

* On the left, we have the sidebar, which lets you easily switch between the various views, such as Budget, Reports, and Accounts.
* The server and sync status (if used) are shown in the red box in the upper right corner.
* The content of the rest of the interface depends on the functionality you have chosen in the sidebar. This screenshot shows an example of a Budget view.

## Top Right Corner

* The eye icon will scramble the numbers on the screen. This is useful if you need to report a bug to the Actual team but want to keep your numbers private.
* If clicking on the sync icon, your local file will sync to the server.
* The current text, _Server online_ shows the connection status. Thus, it could easily read _Server offline_ if you are not connected to a server. If you click on this text, you can change your password, sign out of the server or change the server URL.

## The Sidebar


From the sidebar, you have easy access to all Actual's functionality.

* Access to your Budget, Reports and Schedules.
* Less used functions are found under _More_, like managing Payees and Rules; this is where you find the software settings.
* The sidebar also holds all of your accounts, both on-budget and off-budget; these will display in a list under the heading to which they belong e.g. On-budget.

Most of these will we cover later in the tour.
