# Scheduled Transactions


If you already have data in your accounts, you can have Actual proposed schedules based on the available data.

The system is very flexible, and you can schedule based on various factors:

1. Set to be recurring or only entered once
2. Set to be automatically entered into the account register or choose to manually approve entries
3. Options for recurring entries for multiple specific days of the month.
   1. A single schedule can be created for a Cell phone plan with multiple users and different payment cycles for each phone. For example, if you have three cell phones that all get paid on different days of the month, each day can be defined in a single schedule for each phone.
4. Options to determine the frequency of payments, such as every month, every 2 months, every 2 years, etc.

The manual's [Schedules](/docs/schedules) section contains all the details surrounding scheduling in Actual Budget.
