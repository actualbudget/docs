# Reports

This view gives you access to both the two built in reports, _Net Worth_ and _Cash Flow_, but also your own custom reports.

All reports in this view are shown in their small, tiled, version. Clicking on a tile will take you to that very report.

## The built in reports

**Net worth** represents the overall balance of all your accounts over time. It is calculated by subtracting your debts
from the total value of your cash and assets. This includes all investments. Essentially, your net worth is the amount
you would have if you sold all your assets and paid off all your debts.

**Cash flow** tracks your spending over time by focusing solely on-budget accounts and displaying their balances.
It includes separate visualizations for income and expenses, providing a quick overview of how these factors affect
your available money over time. By considering your budgeted accounts as “cash on hand,” cash flow clearly shows how your available funds fluctuate.

These reports are detailed in the [reports section](/docs/reports/) in the manual.

## Custom reports


Actual custom reports should give you all the reports you need on your spending habits and your income and are
thoroughly covered in the [Custom Reports topic](/docs/reports/custom-reports) in the manual.

Below are examples of reports covering our _Daily Expenses_ over the last six months. One report shows this as a graph,
the other as a table. Note that the table version also shows the sum and average (over six months)
for the various categories.
