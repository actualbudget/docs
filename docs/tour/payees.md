# Payees Management 

This view lets you manage your Payees. In the overview, you see which Payees
you have in your system and if they have any associated [rules](./rules).

From this view, you can delete and merge payees as you see fit. See the
[Payee section](/docs/transactions/payees) in the manual for more details.


If you have any unused payees, they are readily available by clicking on the _Show n unused payee_.

the dropdown seen inside the red box.

Windows machine, or <Key mod="Cmd" k="Z" /> on a Mac.
