# Transaction Rules

Actual's robust rules system will help you automate many transaction management tasks.

Rules dictate how transactions are handled. When transactions are imported or synced, they follow
rules that apply specific actions. For instance, a rule might process a transaction with the payee
"AMAZON.COM*5C7QC7MH0 AM 10/26 PURCHASE AMZN.COM/BILL," recognize the keyword "amazon," and automatically
set the payee to "Amazon" and the category to "Books". Rules enable you to automate any workflow you choose.

For detailed information, please consult the manual section on [rules](/docs/budgeting/rules/).
