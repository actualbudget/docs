Welcome to Actual’s documentation! Here you will find everything you need to know about Actual Budget (hopefully). If you see something missing, feel free to reach out to us (or, even better, click the “Edit this page” link at the bottom of any page to add any missing information yourself).

## What should I read first?

If you’re completely new to Actual, you’ll need to [install](./install/index.md) it before you can use it. Once you’ve done that, check out the [Tour of Actual](./tour/index.md) for a high-level overview of how Actual works. Then come back later to dive into the more detailed documentation in the “Using Actual” section.

If you would just like to test things out, you can [download](/test-budget.zip) the test budget and [import](./migration/actual-import.md) it into Actual

If you ever get stuck, don’t hesitate to [reach out to the maintainers and community](/contact) for help.
