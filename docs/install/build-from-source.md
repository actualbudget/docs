# Build from source

:::info

Installing Actual by building it from source is a highly technical process. We recommend this approach primarily for power users and contributors.

For non-technical users, we suggest opting for one of the simpler alternatives:
- [Pikapods](/docs/install/pikapods)
- [Desktop Client](/download)
- [Docker](/docs/install/docker)

Actual server is used for syncing changes across devices. It comes with the latest version of the [Actual web client](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual).

## Prerequisites

- The Actual server requires Node.js v18 or greater. You can download and install the latest version of Node.js from [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (we recommend downloading the “LTS” version).
  - If you're on Windows, during installation of Node.js, be sure to select _Automatically install the necessary tools_ from the _Tools for Native Modules_ page. This is required to build better-sqlite3. If you missed this when you installed Node.js, double-click ```C:\Program Files\nodejs\install_tools.bat``` from the File Explorer or run it in a terminal.
- Consider using a tool like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com) to install and manage multiple versions of Node.js.
- You’ll also need to have Git installed. For Windows users, you'll also need Git Bash. The Git website has [instructions for downloading and working with Git for all supported operating systems](https://git-scm.com/download).
- Actual uses yarn packages. You can install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) using the following command:

  ```bash
  npm install --global yarn
  ```

## Installing Actual

1. After the prerequisites are fulfilled, open bash and clone the [Actual](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual) project in your project root directory where you want to install Actual.
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/actualbudget/actual.git
  ```

2. Navigate to the Actual in your project root directory.
    ```bash
    cd actual
    ```
3. Install all the required dependencies using yarn.
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```
4. Build the server with
    ```bash
    yarn build:server
    ```

## Running Actual

After the Actual is installed and built, start the Actual server by running the following command:
```bash
yarn start:server
```
Note that if you restart your computer, you’ll have to run this command again to start the server.

### Linux systemd Setup
On Linux systems you can configure a systemd unit file to have Actual run on system startup. This needs to be done as the root user (open a root terminal session or preface each command with sudo to run the commands below)
1. Create the file /etc/systemd/service/actual-server.service with the contents below using your text editor of choice (ex. ``` vi /etc/systemd/service/actual-server.service ```). Note the WorkingDirectory= parameter needs to be set to your Actual install folder
```
[Unit]
Description=Actual-Server (https://actualbudget.org)
After=network.target

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=[Link to your actual-server install directory, ex. /var/www/html/actual]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/yarn start:server
Restart=on-watchdog

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
2. Have systemd rescan for the unit file you created -> ``` systemctl daemon-reload ```
3. Install and start the systemd unit file -> ``` systemctl enable --now /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/actual-server.service ```
4. Confirm that the Actual server is running -> ``` systemctl status actual-server ```
```
root@server:/etc/systemd/system# systemctl status actual-server
● actual-server.service - Actual-Server (https://actualbudget.org)
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/actual-server.service; enabled; vendor pres>

             └─842881 /usr/bin/node app
```
5. You should see output similar to above. The main thing to check for is the "Active: active (running)" section. From here you can consider [Setting up a Reverse Proxy](https://actualbudget.org/docs/config/reverse-proxies) and [Activating HTTPS](https://actualbudget.org/docs/config/https)
6. To stop / start / restart the server use the commands
   - ```systemctl stop actual-server```
   - ```systemctl start actual-server```
   - ```systemctl restart actual-server```
7. To see the system log showing status or errors use the command from before. This can be helpful for troubleshooting.
   - ```systemctl status actual-server```

## Accessing Actual

After the server has been started, you can access Actual using your browser at [http://localhost:5006](http://localhost:5006).

When accessing Actual for the first time, you may be prompted to provide a URL for the server. For a local installation, click the **Use localhost:5006** button to use the server you've [configured](https://actualbudget.org/docs/config/).

## Updating Actual

1. Stop the server if it’s running. You can use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>CTRL-C</kbd> (even on macOS) to stop the server or close the terminal window it’s running from.
2. In Bash, run `git pull` from the directory you cloned the project into. This will download the latest code.
3. Run `yarn install` from that directory. This will download any updated dependencies.
4. Run `yarn build:server` to build the server from the latest code.
4. Restart the server by running `yarn start:server`.

Actual is constantly evolving to include new features and improve the user's experience. It is always recommended that your local installation be updated with our [latest releases](https://actualbudget.org/docs/releases).

## Translations

If you would like to use Actual in a language other than English, additional setup is needed. Run the following commands in order.
1. Navigate to the Actual in your project root directory, and the `packages/desktop-client` directory inside that.
    ```bash
    cd actual  # project root
    cd packages/desktop-client
    ```
2. Clone the separate translations repository.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/actualbudget/translations locale
    ```
