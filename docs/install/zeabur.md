You can always set a budget limit on each of your application.
:::

You will need to pay for a **minimal** **$5/mon** fee for [Developer Plan](https://zeabur.com/pricing) in order to deploy container applications. Actual Budget will only cost around **$0.6/mon** of the credit.

## How to Deploy

Go to [Actual Template](https://zeabur.com/templates/WL26U8), and click **Deploy** to continue. You can create Zeabur domain names or bind your own domain.

_Actual does almost all of its computation in your browser, so purchasing more resources for the server wonâ€™t necessarily result in a better experience_
