# Installing Actual

Unlike most web apps, you’ll need to install Actual on a computer to get the full benefit out of it. While you could use Actual without running a server, we strongly recommend a server to ensure that your budget is saved and can be synced across multiple browsers and devices.

While running a server can be a complicated endeavour, we’ve tried to make it fairly easy to set up and hands-off to maintain. Choose one of the following options to get started:

- If you’re not comfortable with the command line and are willing to pay a small amount of money to have your version of Actual hosted on the cloud for you, we recommend [PikaPods](pikapods.md).
- If you’re willing to run a few commands in the terminal:
  - [Fly.io](fly.md) offers free cloud hosting.
  - You could [directly install Actual locally](local.md) on macOS, Windows, or Linux if you don’t want to use a tool like Docker. (This method is the best option if you want to contribute to Actual!)
  - If you want to use Docker, we have instructions for [using our provided Docker containers](docker.md).

Once you’ve set up your server, you can [configure it](../config/index.md) to change a few of the ways it works.

If you're coming from the original, managed Actual subscription service, you may want to [migrate your data](../migration/index.md).

## Additional Installation Options

In addition to our officially supported options listed above, some community members have written guides for using other platforms or tools:
