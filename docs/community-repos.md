# Community Projects


The following community projects are not maintained by the Actual Budget project but integrate with it.
They are for special use cases or for developing features that have not yet been integrated into Actual.

These and other projects can be discussed in the #community-projects channel on the Actual Discord server.

If you want your project listed here, notify people in the #documentation Discord channel. Before you can ask
for it to be added, your project must have a proper README file.
